### Resume AI Chatbot

Come chat with my resume!

For your convenience and fun, I constructed a Resume AI Gradio chat interface and deployed it to HuggingFace Spaces as a web app. This AI is powered by Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct large language model (LLM) and with careful system prompt engineering is able to answer to user's questions based only on my resume's content. It is a conversational AI so it will remember your conversation as you chat with it.

### Data Analyst Agent

A personal Data Analyst Agent built with Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct LLM and deployed as a Gradio web app to HuggingFace Spaces. Using the ReACT (Reasoning and Action) framework this AI agent thinks, acts, and observes sequentially until the final answer is reached. Using the transformers Python package and their ReactCodeAgent framework, this agent acts and observes with only a Python code interpreter tool. 

1. Upload data as .csv text file.
2. Ask a question or give it a task.
3. Hit RUN!
4. Watch it think and act using Python code and print outputs!
