# Resume Chatbot

For your convenience and fun, I built a Resume AI so that you can chat with my resume directly. A Gradio web app deployed to HuggingFace Spaces powered by Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct large language model (LLM) and with careful system prompt engineering is able to answer to user's questions based only on my resume's content. It is a conversational AI so it will remember your conversation as you chat with it.
